# CPATT
Incorporating Category Exclusivity for Prompt-based Event Relation Identification

We propose a prompt-based method to identify the causal  and temporal relation and employ a Constrained Prefix Attention (CPATT) mechanism to ameliorate the prompt-tuning process.

# Introduction of Code
We provide two different sets of codes for different datasets and experimental settings.  

Each set of codes corresponds to a different experimental setup, but there are no structural changes.  

Taking the Event Causality Identification as an example:  

makedataset_eventstoryline.py corresponds to the template creation module.  

train.py corresponds to the prompt-tunning module.  

inference.py corresponds to the relation inference module.  

# Introduction of Data
Three different sets of dataset examples are provided in the this folder.
